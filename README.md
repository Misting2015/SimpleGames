# SimpleGames

Welcome to **SimpleGames**, a collection of small, nostalgic games developed as part of my journey to learning Python and mastering GitHub. I will also be utilising some other scripting and coding languages as I develop my practical implementation knowledge these are likely to include:
- HTML+CSS
- JavaScript
- VBA
- SQL

## Who this is for?
- **Learners**: Individuals who are working through developing their own knowledge and looking to see how others are progressing and learning development skills.
- **Coaches**: Any feedback into making the code professional and industry level will be greatly appreciated. Please consider my knowledge as a beginning
- **Procrastenators**: I welcome anyone who is looking for some procrastination to play old games to download and access the repostitory.

## Who it isn't for?
- **Purists**: I am looking for support in developing my knowledge I appreciate I won't always be doing things the most efficient way so constructive feedback is appreciated; condescension not so much. 
- **Side Hustlers**: I know I could use things like Open AI Canvas, Figma, Claud and various other tools to develop some of these things. The purpose is to understand from a foundational basis and not cut corners.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to:
- Document my progress in Python development and GitHub usage.
- Sharing easy-to-implement codes blocks inspired by classic and nostalgic titles.
- Experiment with and enhance coding practices in a fun and practical way.

## What's Included?
This repository will feature a growing collection of small games, including(Curtesy of ChatGPT):
- **Snake**: The classic game of navigating a growing snake without colliding into itself.
- **Turtle Crossing**: A whimsical game inspired by classic road-crossing challenges.
- **Adventure**: A simple text-based adventure game with branching decisions.

## Goals
- To demonstrate steady progress in Python programming.
- To create shareable projects for others to enjoy.
- To learn the basics of software version control, collaboration, and GitHub workflows.

## Contributing
As I am at the beginning of my developer journey, I welcome suggestions, feedback, and ideas to improve this repository. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if youâ€™d like to contribute.

## Future Plans
- Add more games as I learn new skills and concepts in Python.
- Explore integrating graphical interfaces using libraries like `pygame` or `tkinter`.
- Enhance gameplay mechanics and design for existing games.
- Implement Reinforcement Models to play learn and play the games.

Thank you for visiting **SimpleGames**! Stay tuned as I continue to grow and learn as a developer. ðŸ˜Š

**Credit** Much of this repo will be inspired by the course produced by Dr Angela Yu and enhanced or implemented by myself.
